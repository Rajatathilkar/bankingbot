Quite simply, the incremental returns that you earn on your principal, plus accrued gains, is compounded. Rupee Cost Averaging: Most investors want to buy stocks when the prices are low and sell them when the prices are high. But timing the market is time consuming and risky.

This scenario has created volatility in the markets and uncertainty of future outlook.

A monthly SIP helps in averaging out the cost of purchase and benefit from the power of compounding. It also helps in creating wealth over a longer time period. The current investment scenario is still dominated by negative sentiment. This creates volatility in the markets due to confused minds of the investors. Such volatility makes it difficult to capture the market movements and most people end up losing money with the intention of timing the markets. Also investing a lump sum in one shot might lead you to miss out on market opportunities. The tool to beat such a scenario is investing through a Systematic Investment Plan.",""
